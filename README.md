# INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_AND_REGISTRATION_PAGE

IN THIS PROJECT MODULE WE WILL SIMPLY BE CREATING AN INTERACTIVE LOGIN PAGE AND REGISTRATION PAGE USING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. THE STEPS TO CREATE ARE AS FOLLOWS :-
1) OPEN VS CODE.
2) COPY THE EXACT SAME HTML FILE, CSS FILE AND JAVASCRIPT FILE.
3) SAVE AND CLICK ON THE GO LIVE EXTENSION ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

A NEW BROWSER WINDOW WILL APPEAR WITH THE LOGIN AND REGISTRATION PAGE.
